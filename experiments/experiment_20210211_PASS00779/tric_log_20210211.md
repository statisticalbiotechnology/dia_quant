Total we have 3 runs with 24916 peakgroups quantified in at least 1 run(s) below m_score (q-value) 0.4316 %, giving maximally nr peakgroups 74748
We were able to quantify 64242 / 74748 peakgroups of which we aligned 2341
  The order of 0 peakgroups was changed, 10506 could not be aligned and 0 were removed. Ambigous cases: -1, multiple suitable peakgroups: -1
We were able to quantify 24916 / 24916 precursors in 1 runs, and 17554 in all runs (up from 16424 before alignment)
We were able to quantify 19248 / 19248 peptides in 1 runs, and 13952 in all runs (up from 13162 before alignment)
We were able to quantify 2947 / 2947 proteins in 1 runs, and 2397 in all runs (up from 2308 before alignment)
Of these 2947 proteins, 2434 were multiple hits and 513 were single hits.
Decoy percentage of peakgroups that are fully aligned 0.7856 % (417 out of 53079) which roughly corresponds to a peakgroup FDR of 0.23212125461886832 %
Decoy percentage of peakgroups that are partially aligned 2.0955 % (1375 out of 65617) which roughly corresponds to a peakgroup FDR of 0.6191386474148053 %
There were 877 decoy precursors identified out of 25793 precursors which is 3.4001 %
