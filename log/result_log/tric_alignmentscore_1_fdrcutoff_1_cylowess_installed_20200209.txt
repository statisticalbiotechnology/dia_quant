Total we have 6 runs with 45008 peakgroups quantified in at least 1 run(s) below m_score (q-value) 100.0000 %, giving maximally nr peakgroups 270048
We were able to quantify 232662 / 270048 peakgroups of which we aligned 0
  The order of 118734 peakgroups was changed, 37386 could not be aligned and 10507 were removed. Ambigous cases: 291854, multiple suitable peakgroups: 291854
We were able to quantify 45008 / 45008 precursors in 1 runs, and 29875 in all runs (up from 34387 before alignment)
We were able to quantify 42810 / 42810 peptides in 1 runs, and 28766 in all runs (up from 32986 before alignment)
We were able to quantify 6971 / 6971 proteins in 1 runs, and 6193 in all runs (up from 6474 before alignment)
Of these 6971 proteins, 5023 were multiple hits and 1948 were single hits.
Decoy percentage of peakgroups that are fully aligned 50.5061 % (182916 out of 362166) which roughly corresponds to a peakgroup FDR of 101.61482246854308 %
Decoy percentage of peakgroups that are partially aligned 49.8109 % (230909 out of 463571) which roughly corresponds to a peakgroup FDR of 100.21613384015173 %
There were 44474 decoy precursors identified out of 89482 precursors which is 49.7016 %
