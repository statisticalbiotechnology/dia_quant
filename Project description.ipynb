    "# Introduction\n",
    "Quantitative mass spectrometry is a formidiable approach to identify differentially abundance proteins from shotgun proteomics experiments ([Liu et al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3833812/), ([Mann et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23438854/))). A common problem for shotgun proteomics experiment has been low reproducibility due to the complexity of samples analyzed ([Liu et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15253663/),[Li et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19294629/), [Amodei et al. 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13361-018-2122-8), [Michalski et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21309581/), ([Li et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19294629/)) as well as the available method for analyzing data. For example [Michalski et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21309581/) has found that only about 16 % of the detectable peptides are typically fragmented using data dependent LC-MS/MS methods, and there is typically low reproducibility (35-60% overlap of peptide identification) between experiment ([Tabb et al. 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19921851/)). This problem is especially prominent in data dependent acquisition (DDA) methods. Attempts at solving these issues have been made by the introduction of data independent acquisition (DIA) methods ([Venable et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15782151/), [Plumb et al. 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16755610/), [Distler et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24336358/), [Moran et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24129072/), [Pak et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24006250/), [Geiger et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953918/), [Panchaud et al. 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217585/), [Weisbrod et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319072/), [Carvalho et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832823/), [Egertson et al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3881977/)), where spectras are acquired to a predefined fixed window. These methods have been shown to have superior reproducibility to DDA. \n",

    "[Triqler](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30482846/) is a novel software for protein quantification. It uses probabilistic graphical models to generate posterior distributions for fold changes between treatment groups, highlighting uncertainty rather than hiding it. Conventional (frequentist) methods use filters, tresholds and imputations to control error rate and often ignore certain error sources. This project aims to benchmark Triqler against commonly used softwares for DIA protein quantification. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have been supplied by with data by biognosys for this benchmarking project. The data set consists of 10 samples containing mixtures of Arabidopsis Thaliana, Caenorhabditis Elegans and Homo Sapiens proteins. The concentration levels are known and quantified using Spectronaut. Theoretically, the results from Triqler should be more representative of the protein quantification, since no filters or imputations methods are used, but previous attempts at showing this fact ([here](https://patruong.github.io/bayesProtQuant/)) have shown that imputation methods could severely impact the results obtained by Spectronaut, making it look either much worse or much better by giving it an unfair advantage or disadvantage. One important aspect of this research is therefore how to make a fair comparison of Triqler and Spectronaut. Sub-tasks to answer relating to this aspect is \"How do we make a fair imputation if we need to impute values?\" and \"How do we visualize the comparison in a meaningful and comprehensible way?\".\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "Triqler is a novel software that uses a Bayesian model for protein quantification. Previous efforts for DIA protein quantification has been dependent on spectral libraries for peptide and protein identification, as well as the construction of pseudo-MS/MS which are similar to DDA spectras and therefore allows for peptide and protein identification with conventional search-engine algorithms. \n",

    "The use of bayesian modeling for protein quantification has not yet been shown better than existing methods, but the fact that Triqler is handling errors in multiple steps in a more theoretical sound way than the most commonly used protein quantification pipelines gives indication that it is better. A benchmark of said Triqler is therefore needed to show its performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Specifically, it is interesting to benchmarking against DIA proteomics pipeline (such as directDIA, Spectronaut, DIA-Umpire etc.) as DIA provides more false positives, false negatives and complex spectra.)\n",

In the last decade developments in MS methodologies has made it possible to use it for accurate protein quantification ([Ong et al. 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio736)). Various softwares has been developed for processing raw MS data into quantified protein abundances ([Mueller et al. 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18173218/)). Each of which has a unique set of algorithms for different tasks of the MS data processing workflow.

    "### Protein inference and why it is problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein inference is the process of obtaining a list of identified proteins from peptide measurements ([Huang et al. 2012](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/13/5/586/415393)). There are several factors that make obtaining a list of identified proteins challenging: (1) There are usually only a small number of peptides for each protein because top typically only the top scoring peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) are included into the set of peptide identifications, which causes problems in protein identification confidence ([Resing et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15228325/)). (2) Peptides from the same protein are not equally likely to be identified in a standard proteomics experiments. I.e. there is a low signal-to-noise ratio ([Bihan et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15595722/),[Kuster et al. 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15957003/),[Tang et al. 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16873510/)). (3) Many peptide sequences can be mapped to more than one protein in a database (they are so called degenerate or shared peptides) ([Nesvizhskii et al. 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14632076/), [Nesvizhskii et al. 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16009968/)). (4) There is a variety of methods to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) [Li et al. 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23176300/).     \n",
    "\n",
    "When conducting a shotgun proteomics experiment we are often interested to see the set of proteins that has been present in a sample before proteolytic digestion. The most common method to control for errors is to use tresholds for the FDR. As the measured entities, spectra, are measurements of the peptides rather than proteins it makes protein-level FDRs complicated ([The et al. 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pmic.201500431)). In [The et al. 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pmic.201500431) it is pointed out that there are two competing null hypotheses in current protein inference methods that are meaningful: 1) \"false discoveries are protein with incorrect best scoring peptide inference\" and 2) \"false discoveries are absent proteins\". These two null hypothesis are meaningful in the right context and can be accurately estimated. Besides these there are a very diverse set of possibilities to contruct the null hypothesis under. Which makes it very complicated to define what protein-level FDR means.     \n",

    "### Protein quantification for DIA.\n",
    "There are a lot of studies about data-dependent acquisition (DDA) protein quantification ([Välikangas et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/6/1344/3859191), [Mueller et al. 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18173218/)). However, in recent year the interest seems to have shifted towards data-independent acquisition (DIA) protein quantification ([Purvine et al. 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12833507/),[Venable et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15782151/), [Law et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24206228/), [Egertson et al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127711/)). With in-depth evaluation studies such as [Navarro et al. 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120688/), [Kuharev et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25545627/), [Gotti et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.365585v1.full) and.

    "The DDA select precursor ions based on abundances and suffers from stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection ([Liu et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15253663/),[Li et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19294629/), [Amodei et al. 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13361-018-2122-8)), under-sampling ([Michalski et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21309581/)) and long instrument cycle times ([Li et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19294629/)). While DIA fragment all precusor ions within a fixed window, regardless of intensity, and yields a comprehensive fragment of ion data. It therefore has the advantage of being reproducible, as well as offering the precision of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) ([Bruderer et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424408/)). However, wide isolation windows produce highly chimeric spectra, which limits the sensitivity and accuracy of quantification and identification ([Armodei et al 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13361-018-2122-8)). Several DIA mass spectrometric strategies has been implemented to handle these problems (SWATH-MS ([Gillet et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3433915/)), HDMSE ([Geromanos et al. 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22811061/)) and AIF ([Geiger et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953918/))). In addition to the mass spectrometric problems, computatonal methods (raw dara processing, protein database searching and statistical analysis of the quantitative data) critically impact the results of analysis. [Navarro et al. 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120688/) developed a computational benchmarking framework for label-free quantitative proteomics, LFQbench, to analyze performances on five DIA approach; four peptide-centric query tools (OpenSWATH ([Röst et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24727770/)), SWATH2.0 , Skyline ([MacLean et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844992/), [Egertson et al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127711/)), Spectronaut ([Bruderer et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424408/)), which use MS/MS libraries to extracts groups of signals that reliably represent a specific peptide with statistical methods to discern true from false matches ([Pak et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24006250/), [Röst et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24727770/), [Reiter et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21423193/)) and one data-centric approach (DIA-Umpire ([Tsou et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4399776/))) which constructs pseudo tandem MS spectra that can be identified and quantified using conventional database searching and protein-inference tools. It has been shown that the overlap of peptide and protein identification provided by the four-library based tools are higher than what is typically achieved for MS/MS idenfications between different DDA search engine ([Bell et al. 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785450/), [Shteynberg et al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3769318/), [Yuan et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4184451/)).\n",

    "- Peak-grouping. The peaks are grouped by identifying the most intense peaks over all chromatograms and using it as a seed to create a peak for all the other chromatograms. \n",
    "- Peak-group scoring. The peak-groups are scoring based on the elution profiles of the fragment ion, the fit to the expected retention time and fragment-ion intensity from the assay library and the properties of the full MS2 spectrum at the chromatographic peak apex.\n",

    "### Missing values and Bayesian missing data. \n",
    "Missing values are a frequent problem in life science studies. Incomplete data can cause substantial amount of bias and seriously compromise inferences from studies if they are not hendled appropriately ([Jakobsen et al. 2017](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0442-1)). Besides the common missing value imputation methods (such as min, max, mean and median imputation. So called single imputation which cause bias ([Dziura et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24058309/))) various methods have been developed to tackle this problem, such as using imputation models ([Barnard et al. 1999](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/096228029900800103)) and multiple imputation methods ([Jørgensen et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111964)). The mechanism causing the data to be missing is another aspect that should be considered when handling missing values if possible ([Jakobsen et al. 2017](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0442-1#ref-CR19)). Bayesian methods have been receiving much attention in the literature for handling missing values in various context, and with or without taking different mechnisms into account ([Ma et al. 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324510645_Bayesian_methods_for_dealing_with_missing_data_problems#pfe)). Using Bayesian models the missingness can be modelled using observed quantities by using known data to marginalize. Therefore, handling missing values with Bayesian models are very natural and comes without imputing, such as used in [The et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/357285v2). However, incorrectly specied missing values also does cause problems for Bayesian models ([Mason J. 2010](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/5498)) and corretly specifying missing models greatly improves the overall model fit ([Mason et al. 2010](http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/1691/1/InsightsSubmitted.pdf)). In [The et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/357285v2) a probability distribution is assined over the possible values of the missing value, and this distribution is marginalized over when inferrening protein's quantity. Resulting in a protein quantity which incorporates uncertainty into it, which is manifested by a larger variance than proteins without missing values. \n",

These very low intensity peaks arise from small noise peaks and local normalization effects produced by Spectronaut.
